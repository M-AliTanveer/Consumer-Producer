# Consumer-Producer
A set of system calls to seamlessly integrate all solutions for the consumer producer problem. Developed for my Operating Systems project.

These system calls make use of the built-in semaphores available in Ubuntu. These differ from the usual semaphores available in C libraries.
To make use of these system calls, knowledge of Operating Systems is required to compile a new kernel from code and to implement these in the code.
